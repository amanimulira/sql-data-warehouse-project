# SQL Data Warehouse Project

## Overview

This repository contains a complete data engineering project for building a modern data warehouse from scratch using SQL Server. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data ingestion, cleansing, transformation, and modeling across three layers: Bronze (raw data), Silver (cleansed and transformed data), and Gold (analytics-ready data model). It follows best practices for data warehousing, including version control with Git, stored procedures for ETL processes, and comprehensive documentation.

The project is inspired by a hands-on tutorial and is designed to handle data from CSV sources, ensuring data quality, integrity, and usability for business reporting and analytics.
